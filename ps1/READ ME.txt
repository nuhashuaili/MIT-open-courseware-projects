The first problem set was to calculate the 
number of months to save for a house given
a salary and a savings percentage of the salary. 
Part A was just a basic salary and savings.
Part B included a semi annual raise.
Part C (incomplete) the user was to give the salary,
an investment return, a downpayment and the cost of the house.
For this task, we were asked to find the percent savings in order to pay for the house in 36 months.

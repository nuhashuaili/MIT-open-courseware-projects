This problem set's task was to calculate the 
number of months to save for a house given
a salary and a savings percentage of the salary. 

Part A was just a basic salary and savings.
Part B included a semi annual raise.
Part C (incomplete) the user was to give the salary,
an investment return, a downpayment and the cost of the house.
For this task, we were asked to find the percent savings in order 
to pay for the house in 36 months.
this code puts me in a continuous loop 
so I added the i variable to avoid it 
and i still cannot seem to figure out how
 to make the bisection search work
I will stop here for now but will go back 
to it once i figure how to fix the problem.
